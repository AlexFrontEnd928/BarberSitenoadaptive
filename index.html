        WE HAVE EVERYTHING A REAL MAN REQUIRES: AN ATMOSPHERE OF BRUTALITY AND
        MALE SPIRIT, PROFESSIONALISM OF BARBERS AND PRESERVATION OF EUROPEAN
        TRADITIONS OF BARBERING, AS WELL AS GREAT COFFEE AND GOOD COMPANY
      </p>
      <p class="stle col-md-auto mx-auto">
        Much more than just a men's barbershop. This is the place where you will
        be helped to find your own unique style. It is worth trusting the
        masters of OldBoy once, and, believe me, the new image will not leave
        you indifferent. Men's haircuts and dangerous shaves are our speciality,
        and we believe our barbers are the best at it. As the famous Ralph
        Lauren once said: "Whatever lifestyle you lead, you must have your own
        style, your own world."

            I’ve been in the hairdressing industry since I was 16,
            starting in a small barber shop at the top of my Mum’s road.
              I have been lucky enough to travel to many different countries in my life
              so far, and even luckier to be able to bring my job with me.
                I have cut hair in hostels, on beaches, in back gardens; you name 
                it across South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Whatever language
                or destination the principle is exactly the same, to make someone look
                  better, but more importantly, feel better about themselves.
